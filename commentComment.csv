One theory is that the Fed is trying to frantically retrieve the circulating coinage due to its metal value to prevent hoarding This seems to suggest that the USD spot price for Cu or Ni and possibly Zn will double in the near future and with ongoing inflation due to bailouts and stimulus that might be likely  Right now the US 5-cent Nickel 75 Cu is the closest in worth when you compare metal to face value melting one today would net you 00409 If the copper metal price trend continues on the current trajectory it will reach 420 USD/lb around Nov 2020 to Feb 2021 at which point it will become profitable to melt 5-cent pieces  The very fact that theyre recalling coinage and passing it off as a logistics problem suggests that a they dont want you to hoard coins and b they expect the dollar to tank in the near future  Does this sound rational or do I need to take my meds?"
